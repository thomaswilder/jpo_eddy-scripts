# build a vertical grid for ocean models
# the functional form of the vertical grid is hyperbolic tangent

# this is scripted for MOM5 which uses the "super grid"
# the "super grid" is a netcdf variable called "zeta"
# which is a vector of the depths at the top, middle and bottom of each cell
# this vector is of length 2N-1 where N is the number of z levels in the model

# this also builds a regular grid
# the regular grid is written to netcdf file as a variable called "v_grid"
# v_grid is a vector of the depths at the top and bottom of each cell
# this vector is of length N-1 where N is the number of z levels in the model

# written by Kial Stewart
# this script relates to the Ocean Modelling paper "Vertical resolution of baroclinic modes in global ocean models" by Stewart et al.

# choose some numbers for ocean depth and vertical resolution

# what is the maximum depth of your ocean (approximately)? in meters
H = 4000.0

# what is the maximum grid spacing (the grid spacing at the deepest point in the ocean)? in meters
dzd = 200.0

# what is the minimum grid spacing (the grid spacing at the ocean surface)? in meters
min_dz = 5.0

# how sharp/gentle would you like the hyperbolic tangent (<1 is sharp, 1 is neutral, >1 is gentle)? this is used to "tune" the number of levels to an acceptable amount
